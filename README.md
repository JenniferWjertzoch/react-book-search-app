# React Book Search App

This is a simple React Book Search App using Google Books API.

I looked into the implementations of using an API to get information about books from Google Books API and displayed them on screen using react components.

I also wanted to learn how to use react hooks to create a functional state.

Check the demo hosted on Netlify [React Book Search App](https://brave-visvesvaraya-9ae86f.netlify.app).
